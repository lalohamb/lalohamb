🧩 About Me

I’m a seasoned IT Consultant and Data Engineer who builds blockchain-integrated data ecosystems.
My core strength is using data engineering discipline — pipelines, distributed systems, and cloud platforms — to power modern Web3 applications, smart contracts, and on-chain analytics.

I specialize in transforming raw blockchain transactions, logs, and events into structured, queryable, high-integrity data models that support decentralized apps, governance systems, and digital-asset infrastructures.
