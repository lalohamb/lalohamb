I’m a experienced IT Analyst turned blockchain developer. In 2022, I founded Hood-Coin to help small business owners to learn about blockchain technology and how to create value from the products and services they provide. Trading bots are used for many goals on the blockchaing. Here are is a list of some of my arbitrage bot projects.
